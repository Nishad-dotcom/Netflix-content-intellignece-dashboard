Netflix Content Intelligence Dashboard | Advanced Power BI Implementation 🎥📊
Executed a sophisticated end-to-end analytical project on Netflix’s content dataset, focusing on high-granularity data profiling, semantic modeling, and interactive data storytelling—entirely developed within Microsoft Power BI.
🧠 Key Technical Deliverables:
Parsed raw data fields such as:
 Title, Category, Type, Director, Cast, Release Date, Year, Country, and Duration.
⚙️ Conducted advanced data sanitization and wrangling using Power Query (M Language):
Resolved nested and missing value hierarchies
Normalized inconsistent temporal strings
Applied delimiter-based parsing to complex multi-valued columns (e.g., Cast, Director)
Executed categorical standardization with conditional logic layers
🔗 Structured an optimized star schema model enabling performant cross-filtering, minimized redundancy, and intuitive analytical navigation.
📐 Authored robust DAX expressions for:
Multi-dimensional KPIs (YoY growth, content distribution by type and geography)
Dynamic segmentation by genre, role frequency, and release cadence
Temporal intelligence (rolling windows, seasonal pattern recognition)
📊 Designed a multi-layered, user-driven Power BI dashboard featuring:
Cross-page drill-throughs
Dynamic tooltips and bookmarks
Heatmaps, slicer panels, and decomposable visuals for micro-level analysis
